Local Media Index File Scanner for Plex
==================
This scanner is for Plex Media Server

This scanner copies your local media index file (index-sd.bif) from your Movie Folder to your Plex Server.

I liked the idea of the index files, but they need long time to generate and backing up is not that easy. Restore is also a big problem. 
For backup i have only a php script running at the moment, you can find it here on gitHub too. 

To restore your index files this scanner will help you. 

It is a first version so please be aware of bugs. But on testing it, i could not find them, maybe i am code blind. All developers will know that ;-).

Please use this on your own risk.

If you find a bug or have suggestions please post them "[on the Plex Forum](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201187656-How-do-I-manually-install-a-channel-)"
